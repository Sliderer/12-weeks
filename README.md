# 12-weeks

[![CI Build](https://github.com/Sliderer/12-weeks/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Sliderer/12-weeks/actions/workflows/android.yml)

This is the full story of creating app for Android, using Xamarin. The main idea is to convert the book "12 weeks in a year" by Brayan Moran to your phone. I want to show in this repository the full way of creating this app, because I will work with some software for the first time.
